###SSD1322-SPI

A library for using a SSD1322 based OLED display via the SPI bus.

Compilation:

    gcc -c -fpic -Wall ssd1322-spi.c -lpigpio

    Also use the following flags for Raspberry Pi optimisation:

    -march=armv6 -mtune=arm1176jzf-s -mfloat-abi=hard -mfpu=vfp -ffast-math -pipe -O3

Based on the following guides and codes:
* SSD1322 datasheet from Solomon Systech (www.solomon-systech.com).

An example of such a display is the East Rising ER-OLEDM032-1 series:

 ** Caveat Emptor: **

 It appears that the operating mode is configured by a couple of zero Ohm resistors soldered onto the back of the board rather than jumpers. It isn't at all clear that the buyer should specify a preference or be prepared to desolder and move them. Not an easy task given how small they are.

The configurations according to where the resistors should be placed are:

    ,---------------------------,
    | Mode          | BS1 | BS0 |
    |---------------+-----+-----|
    | 6800 parallel | R18 | R20 |
    | 8080 parallel | R18 | R21 |
    | 4-wire SPI    | R19 | R21 |
    | 3-wire SPI    | R19 | R20 |
    '---------------------------'

The pin configuration is:

    ,-------------,
    |  2 [o o]  1 |
    |  4 [o o]  3 |
    |  6 [o o]  5 |
    |  8 [o o]  7 |
    | 10 [o o]  9 |
    | 12 [o o] 11 |
    | 14 [o o] 13 |
    | 16 [o o] 15 |
    '-------------'

For SPI mode, the pin designations and relevant RPi pins are:

SPI mode does not allow reads so MISO is not used.

Command/Data mode is set by the /DC flag (low for command, high for data). SDIN is shifted into an 8-bit register on every rising edge of SCLK (DB0) with the MSB first, i.e. D7, D6, D5, D4, D3, D2, D1, D0.

####Operation:

The display I have is 256x64 but the SSD1322 controller supports up to 480x128. This means that there is additional ram that can be used and shifted or scrolled.

Rows correspond to the number of pixels top to bottom but the columns group 4 pixels in each, hence there are 120 columns of 4 pixels. Each pixel has a 4-bit address in the display RAM.

Drawing an arbitrary pixel therefore requires setting the row and column and writing 2 bytes of data that contain the pixel to set.

####Framebuffer:

In order to remove the complexity of drawing individual pixels and accounting for any already underlying image, I have implemented a very basic framebuffer as a thread. The framebuffer thread simply writes the entire content of the buffer to the display in a constant loop. Graphics are simply drawn to the buffer instead, which has a 1:1 pixel mapping with the display. The test incorporates an animation of a 64x64 image (from Fallout 4) and an other 256x64 image.

###To-Do:

Drawing text with predefined fonts. I have designed a font that I want to use with the display but haven't yet implemented it while I'm busy working on the graphics and graphic primitives. Testing with an Arduino library shows up some kerning issues that I want to have a look at.
