    +---------------------------------------+

**NC** is not internally connected but should be externally connected to either **VSS** or **VDD** to reduce noise coupling.

####Device memory map:

    +--------------------------------+
    | Addr | Function          | Mem |
    |------+-------------------+-----|
    | 00h  | Volatile wiper 0. | RAM |
    | 01h  | Volatile wiper 1. | RAM |
    | 02h  | Reserved.         | --- |
    | 03h  | Reserved.         | --- |
    | 04h  | Volatile TCON.    | RAM |
    | 05h  | Status.           | RAM |
    | 06h+ | Reserved.         | --- |
    +--------------------------------+

* All 16 locations are 9 bits wide.
* The status register at 05h has 5 status bits, 4 of which are reserved.
  * Bit 1 is the shutdown status; 0 = normal, 1 = Shutdown.
* The **TCON** register (Terminal Control) has 8 control bits, 4 for each wiper:

        +--------------------------------------------------------------+
        | bit8 | bit7 | bit6 | bit5 | bit4 | bit3 | bit2 | bit1 | bit0 |
        |------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------|

        +--------------------------------------------------------------+

* **RxHW**: Forces potentiometer x into shutdown configuration of the **SHDN** pin; 0 = normal, 1 = forced.
* **RxA**: Connects/disconnects potentiometer x pin A to/from the resistor network; 0 = connected, 1 = disconnected.
* **RxW**: Connects/disconnects potentiometer x wiper to/from the resistor network; 0 = connected, 1 = disconnected. 
* **RxB**: Connects/disconnects potentiometer x pin B to/from the resistor network; 0 = connected, 1 = disconnected.

* The **SHDN** pin, when active, overrides the state of these bits.
* The maximum **SCK** (serial clock) frequency is 10 MHz.
* The only **SPI** modes supported are 0,0 and 1,1.

####Testing:

For testing, LEDs were connected via a breadboard as follows:

                         +-----------( )-----------+
                         |  Fn  | pin | pin |  Fn  |

                CE0 <----| CS   |  01 | 14  |  VDD |-----------> +5V
              SCKL1 <----| SCK  |  02 | 13  |  SDO |----> MISO
               MOSI <----| SDI  |  03 | 12  | SHDN |

          '--|<|--/\/\/--| P1W  |  06 | 09  |  P0W |--/\/\/--|>|--'
             //        ,-| P1A  |  07 | 08  |  P0A |-,        \\
             LED       | +-------------------------+ |       LED
                       |                             |
                       '-----------------------------'---------> +5V

The LEDs have a forward voltage of 1.8 V and a maximum operating current of 20 mA, therefore a 160 Ohm resistance is ideal (for 5V **VDD**) for placing in series with it. However, the wiper resistance is 75 Ohms so only an 85 Ohms resistor is needed. The closest I have is 75 Ohms, which seems fine.

    R = V / I.
    R = (5 - 1.8) / 20x10-3 = 160 Ohms.

The brightness does not change very much over the lower and higher resistance ranges but is very linear of a small range in the middle.
